//! ## spinoff
//!
//! `spinoff` is a simple library for displaying spinners in the terminal.
//! ### Usage
//!
//! ```rust
//! use spinoff::Spinners;
//! use std::thread::sleep;
//! use std::time::Duration;
//!
//! let sp = spinoff::new(Spinners::Dots, "Loading...", None);
//! sleep(Duration::from_millis(800));
//! sp.success("Success!");
//!
//! ```
//! ### Spinners
//! There are over 80+ spinners available in the `Spinners` enum.
//!
//! ### Colors
//! You can also color your spinners without any hassle. Simply pass a color to the `color` option.
//! There are 6 colors available: `blue`, `green`, `red`, `yellow`, `cyan`, `white`.
//! Don't want any of that? Simply pass `None` to the `color` option.
//!
